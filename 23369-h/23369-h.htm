      MRS. DUD'S SISTER

    <p>
      They were having tea on the terrace. As Varian strolled up to the group he
      wished that Hunter could see the picture they made&mdash;Hunter, who had
      not been in America for thirty years, and who had been so honestly
      surprised when Varian had spoken of Mrs. Dud's pretty maids&mdash;she
      always had pretty ones, even to the cook's third assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maids? Maids? It used to be 'help,'&rdquo; he had protested. &ldquo;You don't mean to
      say they have waitresses in Binghamville now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varian had despaired of giving him any idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over and see Mrs. Dud,&rdquo; he had urged, &ldquo;and do her portrait. We've
      moved on since you left us, you know. She's a wonder&mdash;she really is.
      When you remember how she used to carry her father's dinner to the store
      Saturday afternoons&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I suppose she sports real Mechlin on her cap,&rdquo; assented Hunter,
      anxious to show how perfectly he caught the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varian had roared helplessly. &ldquo;Cap? Cap!&rdquo; he had moaned finally. &ldquo;Oh, my
      sainted granny! Cap! My poor fellow, your view of Binghamville must be
      like the old maps of Africa in the green geography, that said 'desert' and
      'interior' and 'savage tribes' from time to time. I should like awfully to
      see Mrs. Dud in a cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hunter had looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear me! she might very well wear one, I should think,&rdquo; he had
      murmured defensively. &ldquo;I don't wish to be invidious, but surely Lizzie
      must be&mdash;let's see; 'eighty, 'ninety&mdash;why, she must be between
      forty-five and fifty now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varian had waved his hand dramatically. &ldquo;Nobody considers Mrs. Dud and
      time in the same breath. If you could see her in her golf rig! Or on a
      horse! She even sheds a lustre on the rest of us. I forget my rheumatism!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Hunter, retreating behind his determination to avoid a second
      seasickness&mdash;it might have been sincere; nobody ever knew&mdash;had
      stayed in Florence, and Varian had been obliged to come without him to the
      house-party.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a straw cushion, a cup in her strong white hand, a bunch of adoring
      young girls at her feet, sat Mrs. Dud. Rosy and firm-cheeked, crisp in
      stiff white duck, deliriously contrasted with her fluffy Parisian parasol,
      she scorned the softening ruffles of her presumable contemporaries; her
      delicately squared chin, for the most part held high, showed a straight
      white collar under a throat only a little fuller than the girlish ones all
      around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Dudley himself strolled about the group, gossiping here and there with
      some pretty woman, sending the grave servants from one to another with
      some particularly desirable sandwich, &ldquo;rubbing it in,&rdquo; as he said to the
      men who had failed to touch his score on the links, tantalizingly
      uncertain as to which one of the young women he would invite to lead the
      cotillon with him at the club dance that week: none of the young men could
      take his place at that, as they themselves enviously admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a well-matched couple it was! What a lot they got out of life! Varian
      walked quietly by the group, to enjoy better the pretty, modish picture
      they made. Their quick chatter, their bursts of laughter, the sweet faint
      odor of the tea, the gay dresses and light flannels, with the quiet,
      sombrely attired servants to add tone, all gave him, fresh from Hunter's
      quick sense of the effective, an appreciation that gained force from his
      separateness; he walked farther away to get a different point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was out of any path now, and suddenly, hardly beyond reach of their
      voices, he found himself in a part of the grounds he had never approached
      before. A thick high hedge shut in a kind of court at the side and back of
      the great house, and a solid wooden door, carefully matched to its green,
      left open by accident, showed a picture so out of line with the succession
      of vivid scenes that dazzled the visitor at Wilton Bluffs that he stopped
      involuntarily. The rectangle was carpeted with the characteristic emerald
      turf of the place, divided by intersecting red brick paths into four
      regular squares. In the farther corner of each of these a trim green
      clothes-tree was planted, all abloom with snowy fringed napkins that shone
      dazzling white against the hedge. One of the squares was a neat little
      kitchen-garden; parsley was there in plenty, and other vaguely familiar
      green things, curly-leaved and spear-pointed. A warm gust of wind brought
      mint to his nostrils. A second plot held a small crab-apple tree covered
      with pink and orange globes. A great tortoise-shell cat with two kittens
      ornamented the third, and in the middle of the fourth, beside a small
      wooden table, a woman sat with her back toward the intruder. On the table
      were one or two tin boxes and a yellow earthen dish; in her left hand,
      raised to the shoulder-level, was a tall thin bottle, from which an amber
      fluid dripped in an almost imperceptibly thin stream; her right arm
      stirred vigorously. She was a middle-aged woman with lightly grayed hair&mdash;a
      kind of premonitory powdering. Over her full skirt of lavender-striped
      cotton stuff fell a broad, competent white apron. Except for the thudding
      of the spoon against the bowl, and a faint, homely echo of clashing china
      and tin, mingled with occasionally raised voices and laughter from some
      farther kitchen region, all was utterly, placidly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varian stood chained to the open gate. Something in the calm sun-bathed
      picture tugged strongly at his heart. He thought suddenly of his mother
      and his Aunt Delia&mdash;he had been very fond of Aunt Delia. And what
      cookies she used to make! Molasses cookies, brown, moist, and crumbly,
      they had sweetened his boyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it, that delighted sense of congruity that filled him, every
      passing second, with keener familiarity, so strangely tinged with sorrow
      and regret? Ah, he had it! He bit his lip as it came clear to him. His
      little namesake nephew, dead at eight years old, and dear as only a dearly
      loved child can be, had delighted greatly in the Kate Greenaway pictures
      that came in &ldquo;painting-books,&rdquo; with colored prints on alternate pages and
      corresponding outlines on the others. Dozens of those books the boy had
      cleverly filled in with his little japanned paint-box and mussy,
      quill-handled brushes; and the scene before him, the rich tints of the
      hedge, the symmetrical little tree brilliant with hundreds of tiny globes,
      the big white apron, the lazy yellow cats, and everywhere the prim
      rectangular lines so amusingly conventional to accentuate the likeness,
      almost choked him with the suddenness of the recognition. They must have
      colored that very picture a dozen times, Tommy and he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half unconsciously he rested his arms on the top of the gate and drifted
      into revery. He forgot that he was at Wilton Bluffs, one of the greatest
      of the country palaces, and lived for a while in a mingled vision of his
      boyhood on the old farm and in the land of the Greenaway painting-books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a door opened into the green.
    </p>
    <p>
      A housemaid advanced to the table, bearing in both red hands a long tray
      covered with a napkin. On the napkin lay, heaped in rich confusion, a
      great pile of spicy, smoking brown cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're just out o' the oven,&rdquo; she began, but Varian could contain
      himself no longer. He could not be deceived: he would have known those
      cookies in the Desert of Sahara. He crossed the little plot in three long
      steps, and faced the astonished maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;but it is very necessary that I
      should have one of those cookies! I hope you can spare one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She giggled convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess you can, sir,&rdquo; she murmured, laying down the tray and
      retreating toward the house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varian faced the older woman, and, with hat still in hand, instinctively
      bowed lower; for this was no housekeeper&mdash;he was sure of that. Even
      as she met his eyes a great flood of pink rushed to her smooth forehead,
      and she dropped her lids as she bowed slightly. He reflected irrelevantly
      that he had never seen Mrs. Dudley blush in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very welcome to all you wish, I am sure,&rdquo; she said graciously. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      didn't know any one liked them but me. I always have them made for me&mdash;I
      taught her the rule. I always call them&rdquo;&mdash;she laughed nervously, and
      it dawned on him that this woman was really shy and &ldquo;talking against
      time,&rdquo; as they said&mdash;&ldquo;I always call them 'Aunt Delia's cookies.' They&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Delia's cookies!&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;What Aunt Delia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Delia Parmentre,&rdquo; she returned, a little surprised, evidently, at
      this stranger, who, with a straw sailor-hat in one hand and a warm
      molasses cooky in the other, stared so intently at her. &ldquo;She wasn't really
      my aunt, of course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she was mine!&rdquo; he burst out, &ldquo;and these are her cookies, and no
      mistake. Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she flushed, but more lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Miss Redding,&rdquo; she said with a gentle dignity, &ldquo;Mrs. Wilton's
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wilton&mdash;oh! you're her sister? I didn't know&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped
      abruptly. As his confusion grew, her own faded away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't know she had one?&rdquo; she asked, almost mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you were here,&rdquo; he recovered himself. &ldquo;You've never been
      with Mrs. Dud before, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not here when there was company,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly noticed the words; his mind was groping among past histories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sister&mdash;her sister,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; with an
      illuminating smile, &ldquo;I used to go to school with you! I'm Tom Varian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad to see you,&rdquo; she said cordially. &ldquo;Won't you&mdash;&rdquo; She
      looked about for a chair, but he dropped on the grass at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've changed since we met last,&rdquo; he remarked, biting into his cooky.
      She looked at his bronzed face and thick silvered hair and nodded
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was six years old then,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and you were one of the 'big boys'&mdash;you
      were fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a long while,&rdquo; he suggested laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thirty-six years,&rdquo; she replied simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He winced. His associates were not accustomed to be so scrupulously
      accurate. It seemed indecently long ago. And yet there was a certain
      charm, now one faced it, a quaint halo of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You used to hand me water in a tin dipper,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Yes, that was for a reward, when I was good,&rdquo; she said
      seriously. &ldquo;I could hand the water to the big boys. I was very proud of
      it. You drank a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled. &ldquo;I was born thirsty,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;By George, how it
      comes back! I can see it now, that school-house! Funny little red thing&mdash;remember
      how it looked? Big shelf around the sides for a desk, and another under
      that for the books? Bench all round the room to sit on, and we just
      whopped our legs over and faced round to recite? And carved&mdash;Lord! I
      don't believe there was an inch of the wood, all told, that was clear! I
      nearly cut my thumb off there, one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the big girls fainted away,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;and they laid her on the
      floor and told me to bring a dipper of water; but my hand shook so I
      spilled it all over my apron, and she came to before we got more. I was
      very timid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began on another cooky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have two pigtails? And striped stockings?&rdquo; he inquired, his eyes
      fixed reminiscently on the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And played some game with stones? I can't just remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was houses,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;We little girls used to make little
      houses&mdash;just marked out with stones in squares on the ground; and if
      you boys felt like it, you'd bring us big flat stones to eat our dinner
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; It all came back to him. &ldquo;And then you'd race off to get
      flag-root or something, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And gobble our dinner as we ran. It was fun, all the same,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a mite you were, to be in school!&rdquo; he said wonderingly. &ldquo;What
      under heaven did you study?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't remember at all,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;But I suppose I spelled. Do you
      remember the spelling-matches? And how you big ones wanted to 'leave off
      head'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled. &ldquo;I should say I did! And sometimes the greatest idiot would
      'leave off head' because there wasn't any more time. It was maddening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He munched in silence for a while, and she did not dream of interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the winter, though&mdash;George! but it was cold! We used to
      positively swim through the drifts. I tell you, there aren't any such
      snows now! How did you get there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only went in the summer,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I used to come in all stained
      with the berries I ate along the way. It was dreadful&rdquo;&mdash;she grew
      stern, as if addressing the little girl in striped stockings and pigtails&mdash;&ldquo;the
      way I ate berries! I used to eat the bushes clean on the way to school!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had got over her first shyness, and had gained time to realize her big
      apron, which she hastily untied. He caught the motion and protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Keep it on! I haven't seen a woman&mdash;a lady&mdash;in an apron
      for years! Please keep it on! And do go on with the&mdash;the mess in the
      dish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mess&rdquo;&mdash;she bent her brows reprovingly&mdash;&ldquo;it's mayonnaise
      sauce. But I don't think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up to put the bowl in her lap. A sudden twinge in his knee wrung
      an involuntary groan from him. He walked a little stiffly toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have rheumatism! And you sat all the time on that damp grass!&rdquo; she
      cried reproachfully. &ldquo;I thought at first it was the craziest thing to do,
      but I didn't dare say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ignored the charge but smiled at the confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you're not afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She blushed again. It was very becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems&mdash;it seems foolish to act like strangers when it's been so
      long&mdash;we remember so well&mdash;&rdquo; She sighed a little. He studied her
      face&mdash;so like her sister's and so utterly different. The same gray
      eyes, but calm and drooped; the same clear white skin, but a fuller, yes,
      a more matronly face, a riper, sweeter, more restful curve. The soft dark
      shadows that accentuated Mrs. Dudley's eyes were lacking; a group of tiny
      wrinkles at the corners gave her instead a pleasant, humorous regard that
      her sister's literal directness missed utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nervous under his scrutiny, she rose hastily, and before he could prevent
      her she had brought him a roomy arm-chair from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At our age there's no use in running risks,&rdquo; she said simply, &ldquo;you ought
      not to sit on the grass; leave that for the young folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he winced, but dropped with relief into the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one must keep up with the procession, you know!&rdquo; he said lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply; and as she lifted the bottle and began to beat the
      yellow mass again, it occurred to him that the remark was exceptionally
      silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it have to go in slowly like that&mdash;the whole bottleful?&rdquo; he
      inquired lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Or it curdles,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;The cook sprained his wrist
      yesterday. He never allows anybody to make the mayonnaise&mdash;he can't
      trust them&mdash;and I was glad to do it for him. He says mine is as good
      as his. Did you ever see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; Varian returned. &ldquo;But he doesn't need to be seen to be
      appreciated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange suspicion crept over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you often&mdash;Do you do much&mdash;How is it that you&mdash;&rdquo; He
      could not say it properly. Was it possible that Mrs. Dud&mdash;&mdash; It
      was unworthy of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his meaning, and her cool gray eyes met his with their
      uncompromising directness. He seemed convicted of unnecessary shuffling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lizzie asked me not to do anything,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;She wanted me
      to enjoy myself with her friends. But I'm not used to so much society, and
      I don't want to be any hinderance. I'm not so young as I used to be. I'd
      have liked the gayety well enough when I was a girl, but I guess it tires
      me a little now. There seems to be so much going on all the time. Lizzie
      says she's resting, but it wouldn't rest me. Do you find it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He recalled his yesterday's programme: driving a pulling team all the
      morning; carrying Mrs. Dud's heavy bag over the links all the afternoon&mdash;she
      preferred her friends to caddies; prompting for the dramatics rehearsal,
      with a poor light, all the evening, while the actors gossiped and
      squabbled and flirted contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not always restful,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It makes my head ache,&rdquo; she remarked placidly. &ldquo;I like to see the girls
      enjoy themselves. I'm glad they're happy&mdash;some of those visiting
      Lizzie are so pretty!&mdash;but I'm glad I haven't got to run about so
      much. I'm very fond of driving myself, if I have a good quiet horse that
      won't shy and doesn't go fast, and Lizzie has one for me&mdash;a white one
      that's gentle&mdash;and I drive about in the phaëton a great deal. The
      doctor that came that night&mdash;were you here?&mdash;when Mrs. Page
      fainted and they couldn't bring her to (it seems she was in the habit of
      taking some medicine to make her sleep, and it weakened her heart) asked
      me if I wouldn't like to take out some patients of his, and so I called
      for a very nice lady&mdash;a Mrs. Williams; you probably don't know her?&mdash;and
      after that a young girl with spinal trouble, and&mdash;and several others.
      They seemed to enjoy it, and I'm sure I did. Once I took a young girl
      that's staying here&mdash;she had a bad headache. She was a sweet girl,
      and I liked her. She said the drive helped her a great deal. It's
      astonishing&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes met his wonderingly&mdash;&ldquo;how much trouble
      you can have, with all the money you want! I&mdash;I was sorry for her,&rdquo;
       she added, half to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he thought he leaned forward, took her hand with the silver
      tablespoon in it, and kissed it gently. He admired her as he would admire
      some charming soft pastel hung in a cool white room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How sweet and good you are!&rdquo; he said warmly; and then, to cover her deep
      embarrassment and his own sudden emotion, he continued quickly, &ldquo;Are you
      very busy in the morning, always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are different things,&rdquo; she murmured, still looking at her spoon. &ldquo;I
      have letters to write&mdash;I keep up with a good many old friends in
      Binghamville and Albany, where I lived with my married niece ten years,
      till they moved West. I loved her children; I half brought them up. One
      died; I can't seem to get over it&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes filled, and she made no
      effort to cover two tears that slipped over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varian took her hand again. &ldquo;I know about that&mdash;I know!&rdquo; he said
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are my flowers; I do so enjoy the beds and the greenhouses
      here,&rdquo; she went on more cheerfully. &ldquo;The gardeners are very kind to me&mdash;I
      think they like to have me come in. Mr. McFadden gives me a good many
      slips and cuttings. I love flowers dearly. Then I read a good deal, and
      there is always some little thing to do for the young girls here. They&mdash;the
      ones I know&mdash;come in for a moment while I mend something, or pin
      their things in the back, and it's surprising how much there is to do!
      They fly about so they can't stop to take care of their things. They talk
      to me while I set them straight, and it's very interesting. I tell Lizzie
      I go out a great deal, just hearing about their adventures, when she drops
      in to see me. She never forgets me; she brings somebody to my sitting-room
      every day or so that she thinks I'd enjoy meeting&mdash;and I always do.
      She never makes a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's wonderful,&rdquo; Varian agreed easily. &ldquo;There's nobody like Mrs.
      Dud, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped her work a moment and looked curiously at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You all say it&mdash;in just that
      way; but I don't think I quite see what you mean. Why is she wonderful?
      Because she looks so young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, in the first place,&rdquo; Varian returned, with a smile, &ldquo;but not only
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course that is very strange,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;Now Lizzie is three years
      older than I. You would never think it, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he agreed, still smiling; &ldquo;but then, Mrs. Dud looks younger than
      everybody. It is her specialty. I think what we mean,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is
      her amazing capacity; she does so much, so ridiculously much, and so much
      better than other people. We try to keep up with things&mdash;your sister
      is a little bit ahead. She seems to have always been doing the very latest
      thing, you see. And all her responsibilities, her various affairs&mdash;it
      makes one's head swim! The women have set themselves a tremendous field to
      cover nowadays, and when one succeeds so admirably&mdash;&rdquo; He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But everything is done for her!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Why, I have never yet
      seen all the servants in this house! And you know there is a housekeeper?
      Lizzie sees her a little while in the morning, that's all. And she never
      sews a stitch&mdash;there's a seamstress here all the time, you know, and
      that has nothing to do with the clothes that come home in boxes. And
      little Dudley has his tutor, and his old nurse that looks after his
      clothes. What is it that she does to make it so wonderful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He only smiled at her perplexity, and she added confidentially:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzie wanted me to go to her dressmaker, but I didn't like the idea of a
      man, to begin with, and then I knew Miss Simms would feel so hurt. She
      lives in Albany, and she's made my dresses for so long that I thought,
      though she may not be so stylish, I'd better keep up with her; wouldn't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A perfectly unreasonable tenderness surged through his heart. How sweet
      she was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she made that dress, I certainly should!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smoothed the crisp lavender folds deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is only a cotton dress,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But she made my gray silk,
      too, and Lizzie herself said it fitted beautifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up the bottle again: it was nearly empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now my mother,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;<i>she</i> was wonderful, if you like. Do you
      know what my mother used to do? We lived on the farm, you know, like
      yours, and most of the work of that farm mother did. She did the cooking&mdash;for
      all the hired hands, too; she made the butter, and took care of the hens;
      she made the candles and the soap; she made the carpets and all our
      clothes&mdash;my brothers', too; and she put up preserves and jellies and
      cordials, and did the most beautiful embroidery; I have some of mother's
      embroidered collars, and I can't do anything like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was tremendous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My Aunt Delia did that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were old-fashioned, even for then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everybody didn't do so
      much, of course, as we did. Lizzie says we were just on the edge of the
      new age. It certainly is different. And of course I wouldn't go back to it
      for anything. After we came back from boarding-school it was all changed.
      We moved, then, nearer the town. But, do you know, my mother went to
      singing-school, and Lizzie was looking that up in a book, the other day,
      to see what they did&mdash;she wanted it for a party!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. &ldquo;That <i>is</i> delicious!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what I found to-day!&rdquo; she added, drawing a small object from her
      pocket. &ldquo;I hunted it up to show Miss Porter tonight. She was so interested
      when I told her about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She showed him, with a tender amusement, a little slender white silk
      mitten. Around the wrist was embroidered in dark blue a legend in Old
      English script. He puzzled it out: <i>A Whig or no Husband!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was mother's,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the girls wore them then. She was quite a
      belle, mother was! And when people ask me how Lizzie does so much, I say
      that she inherits it. But at her age mother was broken down and old. She
      had to be. There were nine of us, and here there's only little Dudley, and
      it was so long before he came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat quietly. The setting sun flamed through the crab-apples and
      burnished the fur of the tortoise-shell cat. The mint smelled strong. The
      sweet, mellow summer evening was reflected in her handsome face, with its
      delicate lines, that only added a restful charm to forehead and cheek. He
      had no need to talk; it was very, very pleasant sitting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A maid came out to get the mayonnaise, and the spell was broken. He took
      out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just time to dress,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Will you be here again? We must talk old
      times once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and seemed to assent, but her eyes were not on him; she was
      still in a revery. He walked softly away. She seemed hardly to notice him,
      and his last backward glance found the quiet of the picture unbroken;
      again it was a page from the Greenaway book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the terrace; laughter and applause from the piazza caught his
      ear. Fresh from the atmosphere he had left, he stared in amazement at the
      scene before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift figures were scudding from one to another of the four great elms
      that marked out a natural rectangle on the smooth side lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puss! puss! Here, puss!&rdquo; a high voice called, and a tall slender girl in
      a swish of lace and pink draperies rushed across one side of the square. A
      portly trousered figure essayed to gain the tree she had left, but a
      romping girl in white caught him easily, while Mrs. Dud, the tail of her
      gown thrown over her arm, skimmed triumphantly across to her partner's
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more, one more, colonel. You can't give up, now you're caught! One
      more before we go in!&rdquo; called the pink girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's Mr. Varian. Come and help us out&mdash;the colonel's beaten!&rdquo;
       added Mrs. Dud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, puss! here, puss!&rdquo; With excited little shrieks and laughs they
      dashed by, the colonel making ineffectual grabs at their elusive skirts.
      Varian shook his head good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late, too late!&rdquo; he called back, and taking pity on the puffing,
      purple colonel, he bore him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! I'm just about winded! I'd have dropped in my tracks,&rdquo;
       complained the rescued man, breathing hard as they rounded the shrubbery.
      In the corner two figures, half seen in the dark, leaned toward each other
      an imperceptible moment. The colonel laughed contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I see that sort of thing, I think we've made a mistake&mdash;eh,
      Varian?&rdquo; he said, half serious. &ldquo;It's a poor job, getting old alone. Live
      at the club, visit here and there, make yourself agreeable to get asked
      again, nobody to care if you're sick, always play the other fellow's game&mdash;little
      monotonous after a while, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varian nodded. &ldquo;Right enough,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different ending to their route!&rdquo; suggested the colonel, jerking his
      elbow back toward the two in the shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; The answer was laconic, but the pictures that swept through
      his brain took on a precision and color that half frightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no idea how frequently he dropped in at the little court behind the
      hedge after that. Sometimes he sat and mused alone there; more than once
      he took a surreptitious afternoon nap. He developed a dormant fancy for
      gardening, and walked with his new-old friend contentedly among the
      deserted garden paths. He studied her hair especially, wondering why it
      was that the little tender flecks of white attracted him so. At dinner he
      secretly tried to rouse in himself the same desire to stroke the gleaming
      silver fleece, high-dressed, puffed, and ornamented with jet, of the woman
      opposite him, whose hair, somewhat prematurely turned snowy, had won her a
      great vogue among her friends. But he never succeeded. She was absolutely
      too effective. She turned the simplest gathering to a fancy-dress ball, he
      decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had supposed that it was the quaint privacy of their acquaintance that
      charmed him particularly&mdash;the feeling of an almost double existence;
      but when Mrs. Dud, who, he afterwards reflected, was of course omniscient,
      restrained herself no longer, and thanked him with a pretty sincerity for
      his delicate and appreciated courtesy, intimating charmingly that she
      realized the personal motive, a veil suddenly dropped. He gasped, shook
      himself, colored a little, and met her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm not so kind as you think,&rdquo; he said, a little awkwardly.
      &ldquo;I've been an old fool, I see. Do you think&mdash;is that the way <i>she</i>
      looks at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary?&rdquo; said Mrs. Dud, wonderingly. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The naïve egotism of the answer only threw a softer light on the picture
      that had grown to fill his thoughts. He smiled inscrutably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because in that case it is due to her to undeceive her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am
      glad I have entertained her. I should like to have the opportunity to do
      so indefinitely. Do you think there's a chance for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; asked his hostess, in unassumed stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, do you think she would marry me?&rdquo; Varian brought out plumply. &ldquo;Is
      there&mdash;was there ever anybody else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For one instant Mrs. Dud lost her poise; in her eyes he almost saw more
      than she meant; the sheer, flat blow of it levelled her for a breath to
      the plane of other and ordinary women. But even as he thought it, it was
      gone. She put out her hand; she smiled; she shook her finger at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, my friend, she would be a fool not to marry you,&rdquo; she answered
      him, clear-eyed; &ldquo;and there was never,&rdquo; her tone was too sweet, he
      thought, to carry but one meaning&mdash;pleasure for him, &ldquo;there was never
      anybody else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varian walked straight to the garden. She was training a fiery wall of
      nasturtiums with firm white fingers. It occurred to him that he was ready
      to give up the tally-ho, and the Berkshires, and the scramble of pretty
      girls for the place beside him, to sit quietly and watch her among her
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm getting old&mdash;old!&rdquo; he said to himself, but he said it with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he knew that no boy's heart ever beat more swiftly, no boy's tongue
      ever sought more excitedly to find the right words. But when he faced her
      a little doubt chilled him: she was so calm and complete, in her sunny,
      busy, balanced life, that he feared to disturb that sweet placidity. With
      an undercurrent of fear, a sudden realization that he had no more the
      blessed egotism of youth to drive him on, he walked beside her, outwardly
      content, at heart a little solitary. At some light question he turned and
      faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not have all the greenhouses, but there could be plenty of
      flowers,&rdquo; he said pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flowers? Where?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever we lived,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And oh, Mary, I think we could be happy
      together! Don't say no!&rdquo; as she shrank a little. &ldquo;Don't, Mary, for
      heaven's sake! I care too much&mdash;I care terribly. I am too old a man
      to care so much and&mdash;lose.... There, there, my dear girl, never mind.
      I can bear it, of course. Only I didn't know I'd planned it all out so,
      and&mdash;But never mind. I was going to have a bay-window full of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away from her for a moment. But her hand was on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can plan it out together,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew how she would blush; he had even dared to think how directly her
      clear gray eyes would meet his&mdash;her sky-ness was never hesitation&mdash;but
      he had not dreamed how soft her hair could be.
